## Majalat App

The Majalat App is a mobile application developed to complement the Majalat website and serve the purpose of volunteering. It aims to create a platform for individuals in our Arab community who are seeking guidance in choosing the right field of study or academic institution that aligns with their interests, ambitions, abilities, and circumstances.

Choosing a field of study or profession is a significant life decision, often accompanied by confusion and uncertainty. Many individuals find it challenging to connect with people who have studied a particular field in their desired educational institution or individuals who have similar circumstances. They may seek answers regarding the nature of work in a specific field, housing options, and more.

This is where the idea of "Majalat" comes in. The platform is designed to assist individuals in our Arab community who are embarking on their educational journey in selecting the most suitable field of study and academic institution based on their interests, ambitions, abilities, and circumstances. In its initial version, the platform enables direct networking and communication with individuals who have had similar experiences to those who are at the threshold of their educational journey, currently studying a subject at an institution they are considering or individuals who have graduated and worked in a specific field for several years, offering valuable insights and advice about working in that field.

Of course, the success and existence of such a platform rely on the collaboration of the numerous charitable efforts within our community. The individuals who extend their advice and guidance are you, esteemed academics. We kindly urge all of you to contribute by registering through the provided form and becoming a source of support for future students and academics. Together, let's create a better present and future for all individuals embarking on their educational journeys within our Arab community.

Who knows, perhaps a minute of your time dedicated to providing guidance to someone starting their educational journey can have a significant impact on their path and leave a positive mark on your professional accomplishments.

Please note that Majalat is primarily a website, and the Majalat App was developed to complement the volunteering aspect of the Majalat platform.
